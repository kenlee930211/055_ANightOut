# Project module structure description

In order to **easy for team assistance**, **facilitate business expansion**, and **reuse business logic**, the project adopts a modular structure idea. For example, it can be divided into the following modules:

-   Login module
-   Hall module
-   Game combat module
-   Daily check-in module
-   Mail system module
-   Chat system module
-   ...

In order to facilitate the team to develop multiple UI interfaces at the same time, the project adopts a **single scene + multiple Prefab** structure. The scene is mainly used to mount the UI interface of different modules. The UI interface of each module is composed of the Prefab of the corresponding module. composition.

## 1. Module composition

-   **Module Constant Class**: Responsible for defining various constants generated by the module
-   **Module Event Class**: Responsible for defining various event messages generated by the module
-   **Module Data Class**: Responsible for saving and reading data, basically without any other logic
-   **Module logic category**: Responsible for game logic, including network communication, data processing, etc., and is responsible for updating the data in the data category
-   **Module Panel**: Responsible for the display of the interface UI and the prefab associated with the UI. You can read the data in the data class to refresh the UI interface; you can call the methods in the module class to make various processing

## 2. Module naming rules

-   Module folder name: `XXX`
-   Module constant class name: `XXXConst.ts`
-   Module event class name: `XXXEvent.ts`
-   Module data class name: `XXXModel.ts`
-   Module logic class name: `XXXModule.ts`
-   Module panel class name: `XXXPanelPrefab.ts`

## 3. Module constraints

In each module:

-   **Module logic class** and **Module data class** have and only **one**
-   **Module logic class** is globally accessible
-   **Module panel class** can have **multiple**
-   **Module panel class** can be displayed, hidden, and destroyed directly through the panel router (gg.panelRouter.show/hide/destroy)
-   **Module Panel Class** **Module Logic Class** of all modules can be directly referenced/used
-   **Module panel class** itself should not be referenced by any **module logic class** and **module data class** (for example: you cannot directly operate the panel of a module through **module logic class** Class) to facilitate the transplantation of **"modules and data except for panels"** to other projects. For example: most of the login, chat, backpack, etc. of the same company can be reused
-   The UI update of the **module panel class** can be registered/unregistered through the `onEnable` and `onDisable` of the Component **events defined by the module event class**. When data is updated and logic changes, broadcast events to drive UI updates

## 4. The step process of adding a new module (reference)

1. Create a new directory named by the module in the appropriate bundle, such as `XXX`
2. Create the following files in the `XXX` directory
    - `XXXConst.ts` (optional, if there are constants generated by the module itself, you need to)
    - `XXXEvent.ts` (optional, required if there are events generated by the module itself)
    - `XXXModel.ts` (required)
    - `XXXModule.ts` (required)
    - `XXXPanelPrefab.ts` (optional, required if there is a panel display)
